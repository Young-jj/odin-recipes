   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>Believe me, I'm all for a quick dinner fix.
     And who doesn't love a pre-made pie filling? 
     But something about this Spaghetti-O pie put 
     me in a state of despair.<br>
     Maybe it was the aggressive 
     punching of garlic powder into white bread,<br>
     or the topping 
     of Easy Cheddar Cheese (if you don't know what I'm talking
     about, stop what you're doing immediately and watch the video 
     below),<br> but I wasn't the only one not on board with this 
     kid-friendly dinner hack. Frankly,
     I'm still not convinced it's not entirely a sick joke.</p>
   
       <title>Reinvented Frito Pie</title>
       <h2> Ingredients </h2>

        <ul> 1 frozen pie crust
            <li> 2 cans chili with beans, divided</li>
            <li> ⅓ cup shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
            <li> ⅓ cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li> ⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li> 1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li> 2 cups corn chips</li>
            <li> Desired toppings (such as sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, fresh cilantro)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol> 1 frozen pie crust
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prick the frozen pie crust all over with a fork.</li>
            <li> Inside the shell, combine 1 can of chili with the cheeses and beaten egg. Use the other can of chili to fill up the remainder of the pie crust, without adding enough to cause overflow.</li>
            <li> Crush the corn chips inside a zip-top bag, then sprinkle the crumbs evenly on the top of the pie filling. Bake for 1 hour on the lower rack of the oven. Allow to cool completely, then garnish, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
