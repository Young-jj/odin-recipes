    <h1>Spaghetti-O Pie Has Horrified the Internet — So I Made A Tastier Version</h1>

   <h1>Description</h1>
   <p>Believe me, I'm all for a quick dinner fix. And who doesn't love a pre-made pie filling? But something about this Spaghetti-O pie put me in a state of despair.<br>
     Maybe it was the aggressive punching of garlic powder into white bread, <br>
     or the topping of Easy Cheddar Cheese (if you don't know what I'm talking about, stop what you're doing immediately and watch the video below),<br>
     but I wasn't the only one not on board with this kid-friendly dinner hack. Frankly,<br>
      I'm still not convinced it's not entirely a sick joke.

            <li> 1 frozen pie crust </li>
            <li>2 cans chili with beans, divided </li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded pepper Jack cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups corn chips</li>
            <li>Desired toppings (such as sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, fresh cilantro)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <ol> <h2>Directions</h2>
            <li> Desired toppings (such as sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, fresh cilantro) </li>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prick the frozen pie crust all over with a fork. </li>
            <li> Inside the shell, combine 1 can of chili with the cheeses and beaten egg. Use the other can of chili to fill up the remainder of the pie crust, without adding enough to cause overflow.</li>
            <li> Spread over the top of pie. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> Crush the corn chips inside a zip-top bag, then sprinkle the crumbs evenly on the top of the pie filling. Bake for 1 hour on the lower rack of the oven. Allow to cool completely, then garnish, and serve.</li>
